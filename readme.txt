Many real world problems call for the analysis and prediction of a dichotomous outcome. In most cases the classes in these types of problems are greatly imbalanced (e.g. fraud detection, student churn etc). The dataset contains 12 month default data. The default status of the loan is identified by the column GB_12, where 1 is a default and 0 is no default.

In this example I attempt to predict defaults by:


- Assessing and managing data quality
- Applying single factor and multi-factor analysis
- Providing Model validation
- Assessing the performance analysis of the model

To view the results run the file 'linear.R' in the '/code' directory.
To view the shiny report run the application in the '/code/app' directory. Example screen shots of the report can be found in the '/screen dumps' directory.
